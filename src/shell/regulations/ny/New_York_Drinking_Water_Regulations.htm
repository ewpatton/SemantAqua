A system may remain on reduced bromate monitoring until the running annual average source water bromide concentration, computed quarterly, is equal to or greater than 0.05 mg/L. If the average bromide concentration is equal to or greater than 0.05 mg/L, the system must resume routine monthly bromate monitoring.</li>
	<li>On each day following a sample result that exceeds the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system, the system must take three chlorite distribution system samples at the following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location representative of average residence time, and in a location representative of maximum residence time. The samples comprising the three-sample set required for routine monitoring must be collected at the same three locations in the distribution system that are used when following up on a daily MCL exceedance at the entry point. The system may use results of additional monitoring, conducted as the result of an entry point MCL exceedance, to meet the requirement for routine monthly monitoring.</li>
	<li>Daily chlorite monitoring at the entrance to the distribution system may not be reduced. Monthly chlorite monitoring in the distribution system may be reduced to one three-sample set per quarter after one year of monitoring where no individual chlorite sample taken in the distribution system has exceeded the chlorite MCL. If the system has had to conduct distribution system monitoring as a result of an MCL exceedance at the entry point, the system cannot reduce monitoring. The system may remain on a reduced monitoring schedule until either any of the three individual chlorite samples taken quarterly in the distribution system exceeds the chlorite MCL or the system is required to conduct distribution system monitoring because of an entry point chlorite MCL exceedance.</li>
	<li>A system must monitor according to its monitoring plan as described in section 5-1.51(c) of this Subpart. Failure to monitor in accordance with the monitoring plan is a monitoring violation.</li>

<ol>
	<li>A system must monitor according to its monitoring plan as described in section 5-1.51 (c) of this Subpart. Failure to monitor in accordance with the monitoring plan is a monitoring violation.</li>
	<li>Effective January 1, 2002.</li>
	<li>Failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by an annual average where compliance is based on an annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and a system's failure to monitor makes it impossible to determine MCL compliance. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL will be based on an average of the available data.</li>
	<li>If, during the first year of monitoring, any individual quarter's average will cause the annual average of that system to exceed the MCL the system is out of compliance at the end of that quarter.</li>
	<li>System may reduce monitoring if at least one year of samples have been collected and the annual average of total THMs is less than or equal to 0.040 mg/L and the annual average of haloacetic acids is less than or equal to 0.030 mg/L. In order to be eligible for reduced monitoring, the source water annual average total organic carbon (TOC) level, before any treatment, must be less than or equal to 4.0 mg/L. Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as the average of all samples taken in the year is no more than 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for total trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, respectively. Systems that exceed these levels must resume monitoring at the routine frequency in the quarter immediately following the exceedance.</li>
	<li>If a system elects to sample more frequently than the minimum required, at least 25% of all samples collected each quarter (including those taken in excess of the required frequency) must be taken at locations that represent the maximum residence time of the water in the distribution system. The remaining samples must be taken at locations representative of at least average residence time in the distribution system. A system must sample at locations identified in a monitoring plan approved by the State.</li>
	<li>Effective January 1, 2004. Until then, monitoring of these systems is at State's discretion.</li>
	<li>State discretion shall mean requiring monitoring when the State has reason to believe the MCL has been violated, the potential exists for an MCL violation or the contaminant may present a risk to public health.</li>
	<li>System may switch from routine monitoring to reduced monitoring if at least one year of samples have been collected and the annual average of total THMs is less than or equal to 0.040 mg/L and the annual average of haloacetic acids is less than or equal to 0.030 mg/L. Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as the result of the sample for the year is no more than 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for total trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, respectively. Systems that exceed these levels must resume quarterly monitoring in the quarter immediately following the exceedance.</li>
	<li>The State may allow multiple wells drawing water from a single aquifer to be considered one treatment plant for determining the minimum number of samples required.</li>
	<li>System may reduce monitoring if at least one year of samples have been collected and the annual average of total THMs is less than or equal to 0.040 mg/L and the annual average of haloacetic acids is less than or equal to 0.030 mg/L for two consecutive years, or if the annual average of total THMs is less than or equal to 0.020 mg/L and the annual average of haloacetic acids is less than 0.015 mg/L for one year. If a system qualifies for reduced monitoring, the three-year cycle will begin on January 1 following the quarter in which the system qualifies. Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as the result of the last sample is no more than 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for total trihalomethanes and haloaceteric acids, respectively. Systems that exceed these levels must resume yearly monitoring in the year immediately following the exceedance.</li>

	<li>Public water supply systems must collect total coliform samples at sites which are representative of water throughout the distribution system and throughout the reporting period according to a written monitoring plan which is subject of State review and revision as described in subdivision 5-1.51(c) of this Subpart.</li>
	<li>Public water systems using surface water or groundwater directly influenced by surface water, and which do not provide filtration, must collect and analyze at least one sample for total coliforms near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the raw water exceeds 1.49 NTU. This sample shall be collected within 24 hours. Results of this sample must be included in determining compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of total coliforms in Table 6 of this section.</li>
	<li>Samples taken to determine disinfection practices after pipe repair, replacement, etc. are not to be used for determining MCL compliance for total coliforms in Table 6 of this section.</li>
    <li>See Table 11B for repeat sampling requirements following any total coliform or <em>E. Coli</em> positive samples.</li>
    <li>If chlorine or chloramines are used as the disinfectant, a chlorine residual determination shall be made at the same time and location that the sample is collected for total coliform analysis. Monitoring for heterotrophic bacteria may be substituted for free chlorine residuals. A heterotrophic plate count result equal to or less than 500 colonies per milliliter is considered to be equivalent to a measurable free chlorine residual.</li>
<li> The State may, in writing, reduce the monitoring frequency to quarterly for a community water system serving 1,000 or fewer persons if the system has no history of total coliform contamination and a sanitary survey conducted in the past five years shows that the system is supplied solely by a protected groundwater source and the system and groundwater source are free of sanitary defects. Systems that have been granted a disinfection waiver are not eligible for reduced monitoring frequency.</li>
<li>Fecal indicators include <em>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</em>, enterococci, and coliphage. Only <em>E. coli</em> testing will be required, unless otherwise directed by the State.</li>
<li>State discretion shall mean that monitoring is required when the State has reason to believe the Maximum Contaminant Level or Treatment Technique (MCL/TT) has been violated, the potential exists for an MCL/TT violation or the contaminant may present a risk to public health.</li>

	<li>The month following repeat sample collection, the system must collect a minimum of five routine distribution system samples. The State may waive, in writing, the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the system provides water to the public, if the State carries out an onsite visit before the end of the next month and the State determines why the sample was total coliform positive and establishes that the system has corrected the problem. The State cannot waive the requirement to collect five routine samples solely on the basis that all the repeat samples were total coliform negative. Before the end of the next month the system serves water to the public, at least one routine sample to determine compliance with the MCL must be collected by the system as required in Table 11. If the State determines that the system has corrected the problem that allowed the total coliform contamination and if all repeat samples were total coliform negative, only the routine samples will be required the following month.</li>
	<li>The sample may be collected in four (4) bottles of equal sample volume taken consecutively from the same tap, or a single bottle four (4) times the minimum sample volume. If <em>E. coli</em><em>is used as the fecal indicator</em> at a ground water system, a single sample of three (3) times the minimum sample volume or three (3) bottles of minimum required sample volume may be collected consecutively from the tap and the fourth sample collected from the raw water source. This source water sample result must be used to determine compliance with all Table 6 requirements. </li>

	<li>Sampling plan requirements are given in subdivision 5-1.51 (c) of this Subpart.</li>
	<li>Fecal indicators include <em>E. coli</em><em>, </em><em>enterococci and coliphage. Sampling for fecal indicators other than </em><em>E.coli</em><em> is at State discretion</em><em>.</em></li>
	<li>A system with a single well may collect a single raw water sample to serve as both a distribution repeat sample to replace the "at random" location sample and a raw water sample taken following a routine total coliform positive sample, if <em>E. coli </em><em>is used as the fecal indicator</em><em>. </em>If this dual-purpose source water sample is collected, the sample result must be used to determine compliance with all Table 6 requirements.</li>

    <li>Community systems must describe in their annual water supply statement (5-1.72(e)), prepared in accordance with section 5-1.72(f), any Public Health Hazard that is determined to be a violation, or any uncorrected significant deficiency, and indicate whether corrective action is completed. This notice must be repeated every year until the annual report documents that corrective action is completed in accordance with section 5-1.22 of this Subpart.</li>
    <li>State notification must be made by the supplier of water within 24 hours of learning of an <em>E. coli </em>positive sample.</li>
    <li>Public notification normally does not have to be issued for an <em>E. coli</em> positive sample prior to the results of the repeat samples. However, there may be situations where the State determines that a Tier 1 notification is necessary to protect the public health. The supplier of water must provide the Tier 1 notification no later than 24 hours after learning of the State's determination.</li>
    <li>Failure to test for <em>E. coli</em> requires a Tier 1 notification if testing is not done after any repeat sample tests positive for coliform. All other <em>E. coli</em> monitoring and testing procedure violations require Tier 3 notification.</li>
   <li>At a ground water system, Tier 1 notification is required after initial detection of <em>E. coli</em> or other fecal indicator in raw source water, if system does not provide 4-log virus treatment and process compliance monitoring. Confirmation of <em>E. coli</em> or other fecal indicator in the source water requires Tier 1 notification. Failure to take confirmatory samples may be a public health hazard requiring Tier 1 notification.</li>
    <li>Notice of the fecal indicator positive raw water sample must be made in the annual water supply statement (5-1.72(e)), until the annual report documents that corrective action is completed.</li>
    <li>State notification must be made by the supplier of water within 24 hours of learning of the violation.</li>
    <li>Tier 2 notification is normally required, however, there may be situations where the State determines that a Tier 1 notification is necessary to protect the public health. The supplier of water must provide the Tier 1 notification no later than 24 hours after learning of the State's determination.</li>
    <li>If the daily entry point analysis exceeds one NTU, a repeat sample must be taken as soon as practicable and preferably within one hour. If the repeat sample exceeds one NTU, the supplier of water must make state notification.</li>
    <li>Systems must consult with the State within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the State may subsequently decide to elevate the violation from a Tier 2 to a Tier 1 notification. If consultation does not take place within the 24-hour period, the water system must distribute a Tier 1 notification no later than 48 hours after the system learns of the violation.</li>
    <li>These violations include the following: failure to comply with the treatment technique or monitoring requirements in section 5-1.30(a), (b), (c), and (g) of this Subpart; failure to comply with the avoidance criteria in section 5-1.30(c) of this Subpart; and failure to install filtration or disinfection treatment facilities required by section 5-1.30 of this Subpart; failure to report to the state information required in section 5-1.72(c)(3) of this Subpart; and failure to maintain records required in section 5-1.72(c)(7) of this Subpart.</li>
    <li>Any significant deficiency that is not corrected or where correction has not begun according to a State-approved corrective action plan within 120 days, or as directed by the State, is a treatment technique violation and must be addressed in accordance with the requirements in section 5-1.12. If the deficiency is a public health hazard, the deficiency must be addressed as directed by the State and Tier 1 notification is required.</li>
    <li>Applies to systems that have surface water or groundwater directly influenced by surface water as a source and use chlorine. The system must make State notification whether the residual was restored to at least 0.2 mg/L within four hours.</li>
    <li>Required minimum chlorine residual at point that demonstrates adequate CT for disinfected water from ground water sources at first customer.</li>
    <li>Failure to take a confirmation sample within 24 hours for nitrate or nitrite after an initial sample exceeds the MCL requires a Tier 1 notification. Other monitoring violations for nitrate or nitrite require a Tier 3 notification.</li>
    <li>Failure to monitor for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system the day after exceeding the MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system requires a Tier 2 notification. Other monitoring violations for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system require a Tier 3 notification.</li>
    <li>If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL for chlorine dioxide and one or more samples taken in the distribution system the next day exceed the MRDL, Tier 1 notification is required. Failure to take the required samples in the distribution system the day after the MRDL is exceeded at the entry point also triggers Tier 1 notification.</li>
    <li>Tier 1 notification is required if the situation meets the definition of a public health hazard.</li>
